# THE BOOK CLUB
THE BOOK CLUB is a place to go and meet up with fellow reading enthusiasts to discuss new, popular and opinionated books of all kinds. THE BOOK CLUB should be a place for everyone to look for some reviews on new books and a place to join THE BOOK CLUB's book club. Target audience is anyone who has a passion for books, primarily people over the age of 18 and have good opinions and thoughts about the books they read. I hope this website is useful for people to find new books to read with the reviews section, or find some other like minded book enthusiasts by signing up and attending the book club.
